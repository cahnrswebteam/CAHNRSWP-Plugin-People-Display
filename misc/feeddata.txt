 lived for my school-age years in the Benewah Valley,
 about 56 miles northeast of Pullman. I moved to Lake Tahoe CA. in my adolescence and then to the Sierra Foothills of California where I began a family,
 started college and a professional career. After moving back to Idaho and finishing my education,
 I found a position here at Washington State University,
 which meets my need to work with children,
 families and to teach adults. As an instructor for the department of Human Development and a supervising preschool teacher in the Child Development Center,
 I really have the best of both worlds. My philosophy for teaching both children and adults is to &#8220;start where the learner is&#8221; and go forward. I strive to create an environment that is physically and emotionally safe. One that allows parents,
 children,
 and teachers the freedom to take risks,
 to learn and to grow.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"color: #981e32\">Publications<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Branen,
